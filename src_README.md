# Background

Did you know that ComfyUI supports so called output lists which tell nodes downstream to execute multiple times within the same run? Notice how this output list emits four strings and causes the KSampler to run four times:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303115d3-7c28-42e8-bb52-d02e7cc1022b

*Wait, what?*

Yeah, I didn't know about it either. Apparently everytime you see the symbol `𝌠` it's an [output list](https://docs.comfy.org/custom-nodes/backend/lists). This feature seems very underutilized but it allows values to be processed sequentially without weird workarounds (like for-loops, increment counters or external python scripts) which makes them perfect for prompt combinations and XYZ-gridplots. I always found grids a hazzle in ComfyUI whereas they were straightforward in Automatic1111. Most custom nodes either require a lot of manual work or you have to use some extra-special nodes (like custom KSamplers). This project tries to make good use of output lists, integrate well with the ComfyUI's paradigm and finally make XYZ-gridplots easy to use again.

**Make sure you understand what's happening in this example as it's crucial to work with the following nodes!**

# Nodes

{NODES}

# Examples

## Simple OutputList

![Simple OutputList example](/workflows/Example_00_Simple_OutputList.png)

(workflow included)

Just uses a `String OutputList` to separate a string and produce 4 images in one run.

## Combine prompts

![Combine prompts example](/workflows/Example_01_Combine_Prompts.png)

(workflow included)

Combines two `String OutputList` with a `OutputList Combinations` and merges them into the prompt with `Formatted String`. It iterates over all combinations of `[cat, dog, rat] x [red, green, blue] = 3 x 3 = 9`)

To debug strings it's recommended to use comfyui-custom-scripts `Show Text` as it outputs a new line for each emitted item.

## Combine numbers

![Combine numbers example](/workflows/Example_02_Combine_Numbers.png)

(workflow included)

Makes use of `Number OutputList` to generate the number ranges `[256, 512, 768] x [768, 512, 256]` and connects them to the image width and height to produce image variants in portrait, square and landscape.

Notice that images within a batch always have to be same width and height, wheras here each image has a different image size. This is only possible because it is a list of images.

## Combine samplers and schedulers

![Combine samplers and schedulers example](/workflows/Example_03_Combine_Samplers_Schedulers.png)

(workflow included)

Makes use of `inspect_combo` to populate the `String OutputList` (unneeded entries were deleted) and connects to the COMBO inputs `samplers` and `schedulers`. It iterates over all combinations of `[euler, dpmpp_2m, uni_pc_bh2] x [simple, karras, beta] = 3 x 3 = 9`)

## Combine row/column for filename

![Combine row/column for filename example](/workflows/Example_04_Combine_RowCol_Filename.png)

(workflow included)

Makes use of the `index` combined the same way as the prompts, which gives as the rows and columns. `Formatted String` produces the filename prefix `img_{c:02d}_row_{ad}_col_{b}`.

## Compare LoRA-model and LoRA-strength

![Combine LoRA-model and LoRA-strength example](/workflows/Example_05_Compare_LoRAModel_LoRAStrength.png)

(workflow included)

Makes use of `inspect_combo` to populate the `String OutputList` with the model names (unneeded entries were deleted), and a corresponding `String OutputList` with the trigger words. Both OutputLists are combined with a `Number OutputList` each to iterate over all combinations of `[modelA, modelB, modelC] x [0.4, 0.7, 1.0] = 3 x 3 = 9` and `[triggerA, triggerB, triggerC] x [0.4, 0.7, 1.0] = 3 x 3 = 9`, so they are in-sync. The `LoRA filename` and `LoRA strength` are connected with the `Lora Model Loader`, and the `trigger word` is used to construct a prompt in `Formatted String`.

**If you don't need separate trigger words, just delete the second combination altogether, it's much simpler this way!**

It might be a little confusing why we need two combinations here, but it is important that the lists are synchronized. Ideally we would only construct a single combination with pairs of `[(modelA, triggerA), (modelB, triggerB), (modelC, triggerC)] x lora-strengths` but then we would need to deconstruct the `(modelX, triggerX)` pairs later.

## XYZ-GridPlot

![XYZ-GridPlot example](/workflows/Example_06_XYZ-GridPlot.png)

Uses `String OutputLists + OutputLists Combinations + Formatted String` to generate multiple prompts for an image grid. The values of the `String OutputLists` are directly used as labels for the `XYZ-GridPlot` and they also define how the grid should be shaped.

Note that `batch_size=1` and `output_is_list=False`. If you set `batch_size=4` you get a image grid with the batch as sub-grids. If you also set `output_is_list=True` the sub-images will not be arranged together but you will get 4 separate images instead.

# Advanced Examples

## XYZ-GridPlots with Supergrids

I recommend to start ComfyUI with `--cache-ram` for this example if you want to experiment with the settings alot!

![XYZ-GridPlots with Supergrids example](/workflows/ExampleAdv_00a_XYZGridPlot_Supergrids.png)

(workflow included)

Uses two `XYZ-GridPlot` in sequence to put one image grid inside the other. For more complex image grids the question always is: How should the axis be ordered and in which way the images be shuffled, e.g. do we want to show `cat|dog|rat` x `red|blue|green` and then the batch next to each other in a subgrid (`RxCxB`), or four separate images each with a grid of `cat|dog|rat` x `red|blue|green` (`BxCxR`). To achieve this you can play around with the options `order=outside-in|inside-out` and `output_is_list=False|True`, but make sure the `row_labels` and `col_labels` match what you want to achieve, as this info is also used how the grid is shaped.

## Immediately save intermediate images of image grid

One thing you may have noticed when you make a large image grid is that you have to wait for ALL intermediate images to be processed before anything is saved and the grid created. Thus you could loose a lot of processed images when something happens or you cancel the job (though ComfyUI keeps them in cache and should pick up immediately). If you want to save the intermediate images after each step you can use the `KSampler immediate Save Image` beta-node. For this node to be visible in the node searchbox you need to activate `Settings -> Comfy -> Show experimental nodes in search`.

Custom nodes:
* [images-grid-comfy-plugin](https://github.com/LEv145/images-grid-comfy-plugin)
* [Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)
* [ComfyUI_essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials) (optional)

![ImageGrids example](/workflows/ExampleAdv_00b_XYZGridPlot_ImmediateSave.png)

(workflow included)

Technically this node is implemented as a [node expansion](https://docs.comfy.org/custom-nodes/backend/expansion) and uses the default `KSampler`, `VAE Decode` and `Save Image`.

- **TODO** Update workflow with new `XYZ-GridPlot` node
- **TODO** I'm not happy that this node exists at all as I wanted to avoid custom KSampler nodes. Unfortunately I haven't found a way to [use subgraphs to force immediate processing](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/docs/discussions/532#discussioncomment-15115385) yet.

## Baking Values Into Workflow

Custom nodes:
* [Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack)
* [Crystools](https://github.com/crystian/ComfyUI-Crystools)

You may have noticed when you load the workflow from one of the grid images it contains the workflow for the whole grid, not the individual image, but sometimes you want to know which exact prompt or values resulted in this image. Thus we need store the individual values in the metadata. The following workflow makes use of Crystools' `Save image with Metadata` and `Load image with Metadata` and Impact-Pack's `Select Nth Item`.

![Save Index in Metadata example](/workflows/ExampleAdv_01a_IndexInMetadata.png)

(workflow included)

Uses the `index` of the combined list to store it as a JSON. It also uses the `index` of the individual lists combined the same way as the prompts, which gives as the rows and columns, for additional information, including the prompt: `{{ "prompt": "{a}", "index": {b}, "row": {c}, "col": {d} }}`

![Load Index from Metadata example](/workflows/ExampleAdv_01b_IndexFromMetadata.png)

(workflow included)

This example reads the index from the metadata with `Load Image with Metadata` and selects the index using `Select Nth Item`.

It's is not perfect because in the end you still have to manually put the image in `Load Image` and hook up the values from `Select Nth Item` to get this one exact image. If you work a lot with image grids you might want to include both of this patterns in one workflow.

- **TODO** This is unsatisfactory and requires a lot of manual work
- **TODO** If someone knows a native way include metadata please let me know (node expansion?, hidden extra pnginfo?, dynprompt?)!

## Load all images from grid

Custom nodes, one of the following:
* [was-ns](https://github.com/ltdrdata/was-node-suite-comfyui)/[was-node-suite-comfyui (old)](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui)
* [VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/KosinkadinkComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite)
* [ComfyUI-RMBG](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG)

Let's say you generated a lot of images for your grid and (hopefully) stored them with some clever naming scheme, e.g. `cell_{c:02d}-{a}-{b}` like in the previous example. Now you need to load them from the output folder, without accidentally loading any other images. This uses the same prompt combination as before but uses the string to load the image filename. The following workflow makes use of one of these `Load Image by Path` nodes,

![Load Image with Formatted String](/workflows/ExampleAdv_02_LoadWithFormattedString.png)

(workflow included)

**TODO** Make the combo work with native `Load Image` (but my `string to any` approach always resulted in `NoneType object has no attribute 'endsWith'`). I filled a bugreport https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/11017

## Iterate prompts from PromptManager

Custom nodes:
* [PromptManager](https://github.com/ComfyAssets/ComfyUI_PromptManager)
* [ComfyUI-HTTP](https://github.com/wawahuy/ComfyUI-HTTP)

PromptManager keeps track of all the prompt you generated in a database which you can annotate with tags and categories. The following workflow allows you to search by text, tags and categories to get selection of the prompts and iterate them.

![Load prompts with GET HTTP and extract JSON with JSON OutputList](/workflows/ExampleAdv_03_PromptManager)

(workflow included)

Makes use of ComfyUI-HTTP's `HTTP GET Request` to call PromptManager's search API route and `JSON OutputList` to extract the `text` field using a JSONPath. The prompts are emitted as an OutputList and will be processed sequentially.
